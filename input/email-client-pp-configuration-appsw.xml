  <chapter title="Introduction" id="int">
    <section title="Overview" id="ppoverview">
The purpose of a PP-Configuration is to define a Target of Evaluation (TOE) that combines Protection Profiles (PPs) and PP-Modules for various technology types into a single configuration that can be evaluated as a whole. The scope of this PP-Configuration is to define a TOE that consists of a general-purpose software application that also provides email client functionality.
<h:p/>
The TOE will be defined by a combination of the components described in section 1.3. Specific instructions on how to ensure consistency between these components is described in section 2.3.
</section>
    <section title="PP-Configuration Reference" id="ppref">
This PP-Configuration is identified as follows:
<h:ul>
<h:li>PP-Configuration for Application Software and Email Client, version 2.1, December 1, 2017</h:li>
<h:li>As a shorthand reference, it can be identified as "App+Email PPC 2.1"</h:li>
</h:ul>
</section>
<section title="PP-Configuration Components Statement" id="ppcomp">
This PP-Configuration includes the following components:
<h:ul>
<h:li>Base-PP: Protection Profile for Application Software, Version 1.2 (App PP)</h:li>
<h:li>PP-Module: PP-Module for Email Clients, Version 2.1 (Email Client Module)</h:li>
</h:ul>

<chapter title="Conformance Claims" id="conform">
    <section title="CC Conformance" id="ccconform">
<h:b>Conformance Statement</h:b>
<h:p/>To be conformant to this PP-Configuration, an ST must demonstrate Exact Conformance, a subset of Strict Conformance as defined in [CC] Part 1 (ASE_CCL).
<h:p/>The ST must include all components in the Base-PP that are:
<h:ul>
<h:li>Unconditional (which are always required)</h:li>
<h:li>Selection-based (which are required when certain selections are chosen in the unconditional requirements)</h:li>
</h:ul>
<h:p/>and may include components that are
<h:ul>
<h:li>Optional</h:li>
<h:li>Objective.</h:li>
</h:ul>
<h:p/>The same conditions apply to the PP-Module that is included as part of this PP-Configuration. Note however that this PP-Module may belong to multiple PP-Configurations and so there are some components that may not be applicable in all cases. Guidance on ensuring that the appropriate claims are made is provided in section 2.3 below. 
<h:p/><h:b>CC Conformance Claims</h:b>
<h:p/>This PP-Module is conformant to Parts 2 (extended) and 3 (extended) of Common Criteria Version 3.1, Revision 5 [CC].
</section>
<section title="SAR Statement" id="sar">
In order to evaluate a TOE that claims conformance to this PP-Configuration, the evaluator shall evaluate the TOE against the following SARs that are defined in the Base-PP:

<h:p/>Note that to fully evaluate the TOE, these SARs shall be applied to the entire TSF and not just the portions described by the Base-PP where the SARs are defined.
<h:p/>In addition to this, both the Base-PP and the PP-Module define "Assurance Activities" for how to evaluate individual SFRs as they relate to the SARs for ASE_TSS.1, AGD_OPE.1, and ATE_IND.1. The Base-PP itself also provides Assurance Activities for the SARs. In evaluating this PP-Configuration, the evaluator shall ensure that all Assurance Activities for SFRs and SARs are evaluated as part of satisfying the required SARs. 
</section>
<section title="Consistency Rationale" id="consist">
Fundamentally, the components included in this PP-Configuration are consistent because their use cases are not contradictory. The App PP defines functional capabilities that any application on a general-purpose computer can be expected to provide. The Email Client Module builds on this by defining functional capabilities that are specific to email clients. These email requirements do not prevent a conformant TOE from implementing all mandatory requirements of the App PP.

The following guidance shall be adhered to for the claims made within the PP-configuration to be consistent.
                <h:ul>
                    <h:li>The ST shall include the mandatory SFRs from each of the PP-Configuration's components:</h:li>
					<h:ul>
						<h:li>Section 5.1 of the App PP</h:li>
						<h:li>Section 5.1 of the Email EP</h:li>
					</h:ul>
					<h:li>The ST shall include the following optional and selection-based SFRs from the App PP:</h:li>
					<h:ul>
						<h:li>FCS_CKM.1(1)</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_CKM_EXT.1</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_CKM.2</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_COP.1(1)</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_COP.1(2)</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_COP.1(3)</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_COP.1(4)</h:li>
						<h:li>FCS_TLSC_EXT.1</h:li>
						<h:li>FIA_X509_EXT.1</h:li>
						<h:li>FIA_X509_EXT.2</h:li>
					</h:ul>
					<h:li>The App PP SFRs shall include the following claims:</h:li>
					<h:ul>
						<h:li>FPT_DIT_EXT.1.1 in App PP shall include the selection "encrypt all transmitted sensitive data" and select TLS, at minimum</h:li>
						<h:li>The ST author shall ensure that all claims made in FCS_CKM and/or FCS_COP are sufficient to address those required by the Email Client Module (for example, if the TOE provides its own hashing function, the claims made in FCS_COP.1(3) shall always include SHA-256 at minimum because it is required by FCS_SMIME_EXT.1.4).</h:li>
					</h:ul>
					<h:li>The Email Client Module does not mandate the inclusion or exclusion of any optional or selection-based SFRs to conform to this PP-Configuration.</h:li>
                </h:ul>
